The goal of this project is to develop a more efficient database workflow and structure to better support the community of researchers using the Self-Sufficiency Standard (SSS).

The Self-Sufficiency Project seeks to answer:

1. How can we make the Self-Sufficiency Standard more accessible for researchers who interact with the data?
2. How do we increase data interpretability, transparency, and approachability of data for stakeholders without a strong data science background?
3. How do we create a more automated process for analysis for diverse groups of people?
