title: "Using BERT to Measure Legalese and Formalness of Narratives in Traffic Ticket Dispute Resolution"
excerpt: "Developed a method to measure formalness and legalese level of the narrative in traffic ticket dispute resolution data. Pseudo-perplexity is used to calculate the closeness of a sentence and pre-trained language models as BERT uncased and legal BERT models were applied to measure narrative's legalese and formalness level of narratives."

Developed a method to measure formalness and legalese level of the narrative in traffic ticket dispute resolution data. Pseudo-perplexity is used to calculate the closeness of a sentence and pre-trained language models as BERT uncased and legal BERT models applied to measure narrative's legalese and formalness of narratives.

At this time, developed model is not open to public.
