I am a graduate student at Northwestern University, pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests focus on using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to improve our understanding of human communication. I am also part of the [Tiilt Lab: Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern headed by Professor Marcelo Worsley.
